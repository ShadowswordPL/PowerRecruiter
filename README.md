#Power Recruiter#
Power Recruiter is a browser-based application designed in purpose of improving Syncron Poland's recruitation process. It has been based on a high-level design of an FSM-focused database accessible and administrable via browser.
The application allows collecting data about the candidates and tracks steps of the recrutation process in which they are. Moreover, Power Recruiter includes a Firefox plugin which simplifies the operation of adding new candidates from two social media services - LinkedIn and the GoldenLine.
Integration of two or more different social networks requires the ability to tell if two profiles from different sources are likely to depict the same individual, hence the most sophisticated feature of Power Recruiter - its face recognition system. But for the system, the application would not be able to estimate the likeliness of two profiles with high accuracy, taking into consideration solely the profiles' avatars.
